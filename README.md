Inspiration
We were inspired by the potential of NFTs as souvenirs and collectibles, and wanted to create a simple platform that would allow anyone to easily create NFTs to commemorate events. We also see such a simple platform to be an effective way to introduce users to creating and using NFTs.

What it does
Memento allows  users to easily create ERC-721 tokens to commemorate events. All they have to do is choose a photo, title, description, the number of tokens to create, and a password to be used to redeem the token(s).

Once the token is created, the password may be used to redeem the tokens until the limit is reached.

Tokens can be created for events big or small. Examples we came up with include:
-Conferences
-Weddings
-Dinner with friends
-Dates
-Vacations
-Awards/achievements
